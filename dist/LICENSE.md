## About This Project

This retirement planning application was built with AI assistance (ChatGPT, 
Gemini, and Claude) as an experiment in AI-assisted development by a 63-year-old
SAP architect with no prior HTML/JavaScript experience.

The purpose of this open-source release is to:
- Demonstrate what's possible with AI-assisted development
- Inspire others (especially 60+) to learn new skills
- Provide a useful tool for retirement planning
- Contribute to the open-source community

## AI Assistance Disclosure

This software was developed with significant assistance from:
- ChatGPT 5 (concept development and financial theory)
- Gemini 2.5 Pro (initial implementation)
- Claude Code (refactoring and modularization)

While AI tools were used extensively in development, all architectural decisions,
requirements, and quality control were performed by the human developer.

## No Warranty

This software is provided for educational and informational purposes. 
It should not be considered financial advice. Always consult with qualified
financial advisors for retirement planning decisions.
